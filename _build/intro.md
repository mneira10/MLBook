  will step you through the process of configuring and building your own Jupyter Book.

* **[The Jupyter Book template repo](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book)** is the template
  repository you'll use as a start for your Jupyter Book.

* **A demo of the Jupyter Book** can be browsed via the sidebar to the left.

## Installation

Here's a brief rundown of how to create your own Jupyter Book using this site. For a more
complete guide, see [the Jupyter Book guide](guide/01_overview).

* Fork the Jupyter Book template repo
* Replace the demo notebooks in `content/` with your own notebooks and markdown files.
* Create a Table of Contents yaml file by editing `_data/toc.yaml`.
