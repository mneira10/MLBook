# Python basics

Before we get started with any machine learning code, we need to get the python basics right. 

You can get all of the notebooks [from this repo](https://github.com/mneira10/MLBookNotebooks.git) or you can download them individually as you go along. 

## Python version

We will be using **python 3.x** throughout this book. Please take that into account. Running the exercises on a different version can lead to errors.

## Notebooks source

The notebooks that follow were taken from the advanced computational methods class taught @ Universidad de los Andes. You can get the entire class resources [here](https://github.com/ComputoCienciasUniandes/MetodosComputacionalesAvanzados/tree/master/secciones). They are a great way to dive into python. 

## Additional resources 

There are a couple of other sources worth mentioning:

- The tutorial from the [official python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- The tutorial from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- The tutorial from [tutorials point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/)
- The guys over at [learnpython.org/](https://www.learnpython.org/) have a good tutorial series
- Codecademy has a [great tutorial series](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) but last time I checked, only the python 2 course was free. The python 3 course required a membership
